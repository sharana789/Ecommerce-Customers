# Ecommerce-Customers
Linear Regression Project

- **Objective:**
   Analyzed customer data from an ecommerce company to provide insights on whether to prioritize the mobile app or website for increasing yearly spending.

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization.
  - Explored relationships between customer metrics (e.g., session length, time on app/website) and yearly spending using jointplots, pairplots, and correlation analysis.

- **Key Findings:**
  - **Correlation Analysis:** Discovered that "Length of Membership" had the strongest positive correlation with yearly spending.
  - **Platform Analysis:** Found that the mobile app showed a stronger correlation with spending compared to the website.

- **Model Building:**
  - **Linear Regression:** Built a linear regression model to predict yearly spending based on customer attributes.
  - **Training and Testing:** Split data into training and testing sets using sklearn's train_test_split.
  - **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- **Insights and Recommendations:**
  - Recommended focusing efforts on enhancing the mobile app experience due to its stronger influence on customer spending.
  - Provided actionable insights for strategic decision-making to optimize customer engagement and increase revenue.

This project demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, contributing valuable insights for business strategy and decision-making in ecommerce.
